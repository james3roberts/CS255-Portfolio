# CS255-Portfolio
 1) Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
2) What did you do particularly well?
3) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
4) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
5) How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

1)The client was a company called DrivePass who wanted to create a business that would allow students to be better prepared to pass the DMV driving, and written test. They wanted the system to be in person and online. This would allow the students to be able to study anytime and anywhere. 
2)I believe that I was able to draw out the requirements that the business wanted and combine them into a road map to create a project that everyone would be happy with. 
3)If I could revise one document it would be the use case cards. I would spend more time planning and thinking through each one to ensure that everything was addressed. 
4)To interpret the user's needs I started off by studying the interview transcript. I made a list of everything that was wanted. Then I worked on breaking down each thing that was wanted into the small sections that would stand alone. After I had everything broken down into tiny pieces I would start to build it back together into groups that worked together. 
It is important to think of the user's needs when designing because that is who will be using it. If there is no consideration for the users then it may be very complicated to use. 
5)I am still quite new to developing software and wrapping my head around the process. I try to get all of the requirements first so I have a list of must haves. Then I figure out how the different requirements interact by using a process diagram, then I create a class diagram. At this point I would start to write the code. The diagrams help me see if I have missed any requirements before I start the coding process. In the future I would like to use the activity diagram much more for outlining how functions are supposed to work and interact with other functions.
